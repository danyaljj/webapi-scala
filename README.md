## Compilation

Command-line compilation:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project/webapi-scala
$ sbt compile
```


## Running

You will need the appropriate API Authentication Keys for the search API that you wish
to access. You can request the keys from the respective search engines.

Once you have the keys, you will need to add them to a configuration file.  Use the
included example file (config.properties.example) as a sample.  Rename the example
file to config.properties and fill in the appropriate keys.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project/webapi-scala
$ cp config.properties.example config.properties
$ vim config.properties

# Fill in the appropriate API keys and save

```

Once the project has compiled and the configuration file is set, you can try running
the following demos:

```
$ sbt
$ > run
 [1] search.twitter.RunTwitterSearcher
 [2] search.twitter.RunTwitterStreamer
 [3] search.web.RunBingSearcher
 [4] search.web.RunFarooSearcher
 [5] search.web.RunGoogleSearcher
```
And choose the right applications.
